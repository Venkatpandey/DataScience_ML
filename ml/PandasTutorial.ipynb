Since we're doing data science - this is something we'll use from time to time!\n","\n","It's one of three libraries you'll encounter repeatedly in the field of data science:\n","\n","## Pandas\n","Introduces \"Data Frames\" and \"Series\" that allow you to slice and dice rows and columns of information.\n","\n","## NumPy\n","Usually you'll encounter \"NumPy arrays\", which are multi-dimensional array objects. It is easy to create a Pandas DataFrame from a NumPy array, and Pandas DataFrames can be cast as NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays are mainly important because of...\n","\n","## Scikit_Learn\n","The machine learning library we'll use throughout this course is scikit_learn, or sklearn, and it generally takes NumPy arrays as its input.\n","\n","So, a typical thing to do is to load, clean, and manipulate your input data using Pandas. Then convert your Pandas DataFrame into a NumPy array as it's being passed into some Scikit_Learn function. That conversion can often happen automatically.\n","\n","Let's start by loading some comma-separated value data using Pandas into a DataFrame:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NMK6XgbvnFAt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638356335296,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":358,"user":{"displayName":"Venkat Raman Pandey","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiX1-gtFkBXuRWD5MT2r974RFZkz0drFwOB3KVKDQ=s64","userId":"08732635514214082135"}},"outputId":"acc82fd0-4f2a-4084-c832-74d345f69788"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"id":"cbQ5ydHvmPgi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638356335682,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Venkat Raman Pandey","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiX1-gtFkBXuRWD5MT2r974RFZkz0drFwOB3KVKDQ=s64","userId":"08732635514214082135"}},"outputId":"bc52e519-1a49-4155-abe5-4a82bb1943b4"},"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MLCourse/PastHires.csv\")\n","df.head()"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Years Experience</th>\n","      <th>Employed?</th>\n","      <th>Previous employers</th>\n","      <th>Level of Education</th>\n","      <th>Top-tier school</th>\n","      <th>Interned</th>\n","      <th>Hired</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>10</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>BS</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>BS</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>7</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>BS</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>MS</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>20</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>PhD</td>\n","      <td>Y</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","      <td>N</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   Years Experience Employed?  ...
